    <h2>Basic Information</h2>
    <p>My birthday is september 8th. I really do like my brithday being on this date because of how no one notices so its not a big thing. One other thing about me is probably my family as family means everything to me. I have a mom, dad, sister, cat, and a dog. I am from America but if you want to be spesific I was born at potsdam.</p>

    <h2>Intrests and hobbies</h2>

    <p>I do not have a lot of hobbies but I can list some one of my favorite things is watching true crime. I could talk to you for hours about specfic cases. And then one of my other intrests is to just talk to friends on the phone or sleep since I have nothing else better to do. I also do take intrest in computer which is why I want to do something in cybersecurity. Another hobby I do have is wathcing sunsets after rain or thunderstorms because the sunsets look ethereal.</p>

    <h2>Goals and acedemics</h2>

    <p>My two main goals for my life is to either do cybersecurity or do something in computers. And option B is to go to med school to become a general surgeon. I do not really have an acedemic goal set right not the only thing I want to do is to pass PE this time and get at least 70's in my classes.
